listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager. It is fast, feature-rich, and packed into a single binary. It uses a PostgreSQL database as its data store.

## ListMonk+ — additional features

This is a fork of listmonk with the following additions:

### Editable system e-mail templates

All system notification e-mails (opt-in confirmation, campaign status, password reset, import status, etc.) are now exposed in the **Templates** UI as a first-class `system` type.

- System templates appear in the Templates list tagged **system** and can be previewed and edited just like campaign or transactional templates.
- They are seeded automatically on first install and on every startup (idempotent insert — existing edits are preserved).
- Clone and delete are disabled for system templates to prevent accidentally breaking required notifications.
- The 8 built-in system templates are: `base`, `subscriber-optin`, `subscriber-optin-campaign`, `campaign-status`, `subscriber-data`, `forgot-password`, `import-status`, `smtp-test`.

## Installation

### Docker

The latest image is available on DockerHub at [`listmonk/listmonk:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/listmonk/listmonk/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated&name=latest).

__________________

### Binary
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/releases) and extract the listmonk binary.
- `./listmonk --new-config` to generate config.toml. Edit it.
